# jekyll-post-api
Nothing fancy here. Just a python exposed API which exposes an API endpoint that takes data to create a new post and re-builds the site.

Why?
-------------
To simplify logging data into jekyll from anywhere. I'm planning on making a simple web interface and if time permits, an Android interface too. Both using the exposed API endpoint.
